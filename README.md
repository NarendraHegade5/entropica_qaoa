# QAOA
A module for Rigettis Forest ecosystem that implements a QAOA and VQE that is more modular than the one already packaged in Grove. An outline of what can hopefully be found here in a couple of weeks is in `PackageOutline.md`

## Documentation
Good question, read the code for now.

## Installation
Gonna need to figure out, how to turn this into a installable python package. For now just clone the repo and figure it our yourself.

## Contributing
Lets be real, this is Entropica internal for now.
