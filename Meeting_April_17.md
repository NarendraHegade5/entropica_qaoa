TO DISCUSS:

- Division of labour: for exmaple JL to build out and integrate the parts he has suggested, Ewan to focus on visualisation and landscape stuff? Then see where we get.
- How to synchronise the two smoothly: where all JL's basic functions are for Ewan to base his code on
- Go through the comments in the PackageOutline.md file, and Ewan's files.
- Rough timeline / deadlines?

NOTES and ACTION POINTS:
