17 APRIL:

    TO DISCUSS:

    - Division of labour: for exmaple JL to build out and integrate the parts he has suggested, Ewan to focus on visualisation and landscape stuff? Then see where we get.
    - How to synchronise the two smoothly: where all JL's basic functions are for Ewan to base his code on
    - Go through the comments in the PackageOutline.md file, and Ewan's files.
    - Rough timeline / deadline for the minimal version of the package (& define what that means) to be sent to Rigetti & tested by our team. 
    
    NOTES and ACTION POINTS:
    
    - Ewan to focus on Visualisation.py and Utils.py, JL to focus on everything else
    - Minimal package is essentially everything in PackageOutline.md, minus a few of Ewan's sillier or more ambitious suggestions.
    - JL will also look at adding the ability to have arbitrary cost functions (not just ZZ terms)
    
    - [EWAN] Draw a diagram / hierarchy illustration of the package and all its modules and classes to fully understand its structure and explain it to people.
    - [EWAN] Harmonise code with JL's Pyquil modified package (download from his Github)
    - [EWAN] Landscape should have height for cost, colour for variance.
    - [EWAN] Think more about the plot.object() or plot(object) question.
