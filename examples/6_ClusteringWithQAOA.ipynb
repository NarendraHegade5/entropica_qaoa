    "In this notebook we demonstrate a start-to-finish project workflow for using Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm to cluster a simple dataset. Along the way, we will explain the major concepts of QAOA and build intuition as to how QAOA can be used to solve clustering problems. This notebook will steer away from heavy mathematical explanations in favor of a higher level view of the algorithm's core components. It is mainly geared towards users that don't have physics background but come from computer science."

    "## Variational Hybrid Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "We often take for granted the many decades of progress that lead to today's widespread use of classical computers. As memory and compute power become ever cheapened by Moore's Law, the pressure to find optimal resource allocations for algorithms shrinks away. However, with quantum computers in their early stages, they still feel this daunting requirement. In response to this, a family of algorithms known as *variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithms* was created, with the notion that quantum resources can be made more useful when partnered with classical routines. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), belongs to the family of variatonal hybrid algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can infer a lot from merely unpacking this name. The presence of '*variational*' tells us these algorithms will follow an iterative approach, while '*hybrid*' tells us they will leverage the use of both quantum and classical computers. In fact, this describes the main flow of the algorithm, with all that needs be answered is *when* does this iteration stop and *what* information is passed between devices.\n",

    "*A visual representation of a generic variational hybrid quantum-classical algorithm.*\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer the question of *what*, we note that the main goal of QAOA is optimize a set of **parameters**, which we denote as $\\vec{\\gamma}$ and $\\vec{\\beta}$. You'll notice that these symbols are vectors, as such they are $n-$length. We discuss later what aspects of our problem decide the value of $n$ in the second notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\vec{\\gamma}$ and $\\vec{\\beta}$ parameterize a **cost function** which is evaluated with our **Quantum Circuit** to produce a cost value. This output value is input to the optimizer, and is used to determine whether the nudging of our parameters is in a direction of lower cost. We will sometimes call the cost value an **expectation value**, represented by $\\langle\\psi|Cost|\\psi\\rangle$, which is the expected value of the cost function $Cost$ over the **wave function** $\\psi$. If you were caught off guard by the term 'wave function', then it is equally as effective to think of $\\langle\\psi|Cost|\\psi\\rangle$ as the notion of cost as in the more traditional machine learning sense. The **Classical Optimizer** will return updated parameters to the quantum circuit for re-evaluation, and the cycle repeats. \n",
    "\n",
    "*When* does this algorithm stop? Well, once a stopping criterion is met of course. This criterion is often a pre-defined maximum number of iterations, or occurs after a repeat number of evaluations land within the same threshold of convergence (a tolerance for the cost value in which we consider numbers within an $\\epsilon-$window the same). Once this criterion is met, the **optimized parameters** are returned and used to define the solution. \n",

    "- How exactly do $\\vec{\\gamma}$ and $\\vec{\\beta}$ define the solution?\n",
    "- How do we define a meaningful cost function for our problem?\n",
    "- What in the world is a wave function?\n",
    "\n",

Broadly speaking, QAOA solves the **MAXCUT** problem, in which a graph of $n$ vertices is separated into two complementary subsets, $S$ and $S^{c}$, such that the number of edges between $S$ and $S^{c}$ is as large as possible.\n",

    "\n",
    "This problem can be made more sophisticated by adding numerical values as <i>weights</i> to the edges, such that the best solution maximizes the sum of weights which separate $S$ and $S^{c}$. This is precisely the approach we take in using MAXCUT to cluster our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "We allow the weights associated to each edge to be some notion of distance between points. In this way, the sets dictated by our optimal cut, $S$ and $S^{c}$, separate the data into binary clusters which are maximally distant (and hence, maximally dissimilar) from one another.\n",

    "From our current understanding, we can already begin to formulate some first steps in preparing our data to fit this frameowrk.\n",

    "With an understanding of the Maxcut structure which produces our clustered output, we ask ourselves how we can turn what is effectively a graph problem into the setting of an optimization problem. The answer is to map our Maxcut interpretation into a **Quadratic Unconstrainted Binary Optimization** ([QUBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_unconstrained_binary_optimization)) problem. QUBO problems attempt to minimize a quadratic polynomial with binary variables. Luckily, MAXCUT already has a well-known QUBO cost function. This cost function is sophisticated enough to allow for our pairwise distanes to be meaningfully included, as well as to allow for the inclusion of bias terms on individual samples.\n",

    "To explain the notation:\n",
    "- $\\sigma_{i}$ is the cluster class (-1 or 1) of sample $i$\n",
    "- $J_{i j}$ is the distance between sample $i$ and sample $j$\n",
    "- $h_{j}$ is a bias term on sample $j$ \n",
    "- $\\mu$ is a universal weight applied to all bias terms\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, a negative sign is applied to the cost function, as above. In quantum mechanics we would denote thie function as $H(\\sigma)$. The symbol $H$ stands for *Hamiltonian*, which is an operator which acts as a sum of the energies of the system. For the scope of this notebook, thinking of $Cost$ as any traditional cost function which we want to minimize will serve us equally as valuable."

Including $i$ and $j$ in each `PauliTerm` tells pyQuil which samples or **qubits** the operation is applied to. That's right, in the QAOA setup we consider each datapoint to be mapped to a qubit. Thus, the above printed statement actually means _\"apply a penalty of $Q$ should sample 3 and sample 6 be in the same class\"_, where $Q$ is the coefficient of the operator product Z3*Z6. Said in a more quantum-intuitive sense: _\"Apply a penalty of $Q$ should qubit 3 and qubit 6 both be found in the same spin state (spin up or spin down)\"_. \n",

    "Thus, as QAOA tries to minimize the cost function, sample 3 and 6 will only appear in the same class if this configuration is optimal. The choice of our weights as the distances between the samples implies, that in a \"good\" configuration samples that lie far apart will end up in different classes.\n",

We can readily achieve this using the utility function `hamiltonian_from_distances`."
