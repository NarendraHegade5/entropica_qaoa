Talking points:

- Parameter definition for sweeps
- Logging function values and number of function calls: this is partially implemented in cost_function __call__ methods, but can we extend them?
- Build up more examples of user workflow
- Best type of data structures to use for input data (eg graphs, datasets etc): dictionaries?
